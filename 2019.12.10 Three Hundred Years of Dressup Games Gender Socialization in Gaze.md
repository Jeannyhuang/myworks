In 2018, the official public account of "Vista 看天下" magazine asked: Why do girls always like to play dress-up games? This is indeed the case. With the continuous development of various male-oriented games, female-oriented games have always been covered with a pink layer, from "QQshow" in 2003 to "Miracle Nikki" developed by Tencent in 2015, and then to the new product "Taobao Life" developed by Alibaba this year, female game choices have been trapped in the scope of dressing up. The answer from this article is: boys like to "destroy", but girls like to "create" in games.

However, this superficial answer cannot be weighed. Do dress-up games represent creation? Are dress-up games always designed for women? From a sociological point of view, we should be vigilant about such responses with established ideas. We should think: Is the dress-up game just for fun? Does it include a series of social functions? If these functions are harmful, how can we get out of the game trap?

In this article, we will analyze the dress-up game from the theory of gender socialization. We will see how the dress-up game has developed in the past 200 years. From the social structure level, how does it internalize gender socialization, and from the social interaction level, how does the micro-interaction in the game discipline people? Then, we use Helen Weinreich and Justine Cassell's theory to propose a solution to the game to "undoing gender." Finally, we will discuss issues that cannot be explained by the theory of gender socialization, which will be left to the "patriarchy" to answer.

## 1. The Discipline of Paper Dolls: Mechanism of socialization

Dress-up games are not a product of the electronic age, and its history goes back more than 200 years. In the middle of the 18th century, paper dolls began to appear in fashion centers such as London and Paris, often as advertisements to show the latest styles. At the same time, paper dolls, together with paper garments customized according to the player's appearance, have become popular pastime toys for European nobles. These expensive handmade paper products vividly show the fashion and lifestyle of high society. Some museums now collect them for people to enjoy. 

In 1810, the British toy company S & J Fuller and the children's book publisher produced the first mass-printed female paper doll Little Fanny, followed by the male dolls, Little Henry and Little Frank. It is worth noting that these paper dolls do not exist in isolation but bundled with toy books. The toy book tells a course about growth. Paper dolls will face the challenges in the book and make choices, and each choice corresponds to a different costume.

For example, Fanny, who was born in the upper class, finally took off the "holding toy" suit and put on the "holding book" suit under the setting of the storyline——this is what the upper class expects of women. While Little Henry, according to the adventures in the story, put on different uniforms to meet the challenge and conquer. The picture below is the electronic version of the paper doll. We can easily see the distinct differences between men's and women's clothing and the role expectations behind the clothing. As pointed out in Functional sex role theory, There is a set of gender norms associated with each role. The Male role is instrumental. Society expects them to comply with normative standards. They expected to be active and aggressive; while the female role is always expressive, they tend to be emotional, often passive, and be defined as helpmates or subordinates.

> At that time, young people in high society were the target of publishers. These expensive books were used as education and entertainment as a tool for young people to accept mainstream values and socialize.

Paper doll set the framework for us before we start the game: a person can only be a man or a woman. Thus "Being a man or a woman means enacting a general role definitive of one's sex." (Connell, 1987, 48) So how to enact? There are many Mechanisms in the socializing process. The first and foremost is "Sanction." The children in the game will find that the negative effects of the wrong costume are noticeable -- once deviate from the script, the story will not work. As a result, they are forced to change their costumes (roles) and move the story in the desired direction.

Second, the "model" is another important mechanism. Whether the characters in the story are holding a spear to battle or holding a vegetable basket for housework, those paper characters will become children's role models when their worldviews have not yet finalized. (In the following analysis of Barbie, the power of role models will be exerted more vividly.) Third, "implicit expectation" is also subtly affecting the player's cognition. In addition to the game explicitly telling children what should do (explicit expectation), it also implies that the male and female should assume different social functions, as well as their different social status.

As a result, the moral story in the text is strengthened by the visual impact of the paper doll toy. It perfectly integrates education and recreation and conveys to children the identity, social status, and values recognized by mainstream society. Clothing simply and clearly indicates "the road to success" defined by society, along with what is accepted or excluded under their gender characteristics. In the continuous dress-up, the norms expected by society are gradually internalized and become the goals and dreams which children pursue in the future. It is also from this time, dress-up games have changed from the pastime of aristocratic adults to exclusive games for aristocratic children. The "simple and naive" impression of such games has always affected our attitude towards dress-up games even nowadays.

> By the 1880s, paper dolls began to find their way into households as an affordable game. At this time, it not only served the upper class but also carried more social functions. Paper doll work at this stage left much information about women's fashion.

## 2. When Barbie came, the men left: Gaze from men

In the 1930s, the advent of Barbie has pushed paper dolls, famous for more than half a century, out of the market. This legendary image has become the most widely known and best-selling symbol of the century. For what is "beauty", philosophers and aestheticians of all ages may not be able to give a clear answer. However, for what is "beautiful women," Barbie has constructed a certain ideal type. This certainty was dismantled into a delicate face, a slender neck, a smooth white chest, a straight buttock, a long straight leg, and a sleek foot. It has precise requirements for every inch of the body.

At this time, we should notice that, unlike the period of paper dolls, in this carnival in pursuit of body "beauty," the male dress-up role is missing. The initial setting of single-gender made Barbie a daughter country, and the recreation and education under the dressing have since become exclusive to women.

Barbie focused its attention on women and implemented its discipline on women's bodies, which was more publicity and violence than paper dolls. Under the slogan "I can be ..." promoted by Barbie, it is difficult for us to regard this little doll as a child's playmate, or a weak baby who needs to be taken care of. On the contrary, Barbie is an imagination of adult women, an object worth emulating and a role model for girls. It is an powerful "I can be" doll, controlling women's perceptions of what is "feminine beauty" and what is "ideal" from an early age. 

The men are missing in the game, where did they go? Through aesthetic expectations, the male's "absence" achieves another kind of panoramic "presence". In this carnival, men become "gazers". To be more specific, men are gazers from beginning to end, and Barbie's physicalization and commodification of women make this gaze more blatant. "Gaze" is the disciplinary tool of the viewer to the person being viewed. In the process of gazing, the viewer establishes his subject position, and the viewer establishes himself through the former's feedback. At the same time, the latter accepts the norms and requirements formulated by the former, and continuously internalizes them, asking what the viewers expect as their own pursuit. Therefore, what men want is exactly what women want. It is the durable power of "gaze," which seems to be "absent."

## 3. Panopticon:“Conspire” in social interaction

In this carnival of gazing, the discipline of women escaped from the game and became a ubiquitous practice in life. Panoramic monitoring, from the initial aim of the body to the gradual control of thought, finally produced the subject's self-awareness. Women become their own "normalized" supervisors and also actors: she is manipulated, shaped, disciplined, but she obeys, cooperates, and becomes dexterous, graceful, and available for watching.

Women are actively involved in the disciplined practice of femininity. She is both autonomous and heteronomous. In order to ensure her economic and social status, she obeys the categories, classifications, and norms under identity politics, builds her recognition of the subject, and further strengthens her discipline through male feedback. At the same time, the norms of patriarchy have been internalized. In the norms of heterosexuality, people can only be men or women. Women need to confirm their female identity through practice continuously. She needs to continually act in a retiring manner, projecting shyness, and withholding sexual of fragility. In other words, she can only feel that she is an existing individual through constant affirmation.

For this reason, the monitoring of women is not only the male gaze but also the mutual monitoring of women. Women's pressure on their bodies not only comes from the expectation of potential patriarchy but also direct and explicit supervision from women. This supervision is based on women's own patriarchal identity, which is continued and strengthened through the media, film, and television, or daily conversation.

In the eyes of Sandra Bartky, a feminist scholar who developed Foucault's ideas, "she" has become a prisoner in a panoramic prison, a subject of self-monitoring, and a self loyal to continuous self-monitoring. This self-monitoring is not just obedience to men, but obedience to patriarchy internalized by both men and women. Of course, such self-monitoring requires a lot of energy and financial resources. Daily makeup, 24/7 skincare products, hair oil, body lotion, waist tightening, and even plastic surgery... Although women's resources are straining to standardize their bodies according to the "ideal body," in this tyranny of beauty, the ultimate quest for beauty is endless, and women spend their lives fighting the "beauty penalty" of inevitable aging.

In this context, let us look back at the dress-up games on the Internet. It has become a brand new platform for women to project their bodies. On this platform, we will see how electronic games socialize people in new forms.

## 4.Brave New World: Electronic dress-up games

Let us look back at these electronic dress-up games. We will find that whether QQ show, Miracle Nikki, or Taobao life, they are all based on heterosexual, male-dominated patriarchy. The gender discipline brought by dress-ups has not disappeared with the change of technology. On the contrary, these "gender technologies" have always reaffirmed a gender-biased society.

Let us take "Taobao Life" as an example. When entering the system for the first time, players need to choose their gender: boy or girl. Without changing genders, girls cannot choose clothes for boys' suits, nor can they make gestures for male players, and vice versa. It is worth noting that the game uses "boy / girl" instead of "men / women" or "male / female" to refer to gender, which not only confirms the subconsciousness of "naive" dress-up games but also works exceptionally well in the context of disciplining women.

![image-20200222124602679](C:\Users\DELL\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200222124602679.png)

![image-20200222124630370](C:\Users\DELL\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200222124630370.png)

"Doing gender" considers gender as a social construct rather than an innate physiological factor, and emphasizes attention to people's daily interactions and the underlying rules. Drawing on this concept, under the setting of Taobao's life, the gender discipline of women can be regarded as "being a girl". For women, they should always maintain a young, ignorance, and pretty. In the game, 28 girls' unique gestures include "shyness," "heart-to-heart," and "Liang Xiang(亮相)." Almost every action can be disassembled into four significant elements: LanHuaZhi(兰花指), tilting head, tiptoe or jumping, and twisting the body into an S shape. No matter what the woman wears, these actions make the woman instantly become a girl under the age of 18, which wipes out the professionalism, maturity, and other diversified temperaments associated initially with clothing.

Also, the biggest movement of girls is "LiangXiang." After rotating 360 degrees, the girl places the "LanHuaZhi" on her face. This is an action with a strong sense of commodification. By showing itself to the "gazer" in all directions, the female character places herself in a "viewed" position. This way of showing does not exist in boys' exclusive actions. From the perspective of active and passive actions, girls rarely have active actions. Such as "being invited ", which corresponds to "invite" in boys'gestures, and "please give me a call" corresponds to "call me."  What is more, "Negation" is also the exclusive action of boys. In this dress-up game, girls have no right to deny.

These games, with many options, seem to give players autonomy. It seems that players have endless outfits to match and various action positions to choose from, but, as long as the core ideology based on the service of patriarchy is not changed, every link of the game will be strictly limited. Men will never be able to wear skirts, as this poses a threat to their "masculinity," while women will be excluded from the rejection system again and again, as society expects them to be gentle, non-aggressive, and subordinate. Therefore, no matter how many seemingly plentiful choices the player makes, the essence of the game runs counter to pluralism and equality, and it helps to strengthen patriarchy gender poles.

## 5. How to undoing gender in socialization?

How do we "undoing gender" when "doing gender" goes into all aspects of the game? The answer is also in the game: Breaking the dressing discipline starts with dressing. As mentioned earlier, dress-up games have assumed the social function of education from the beginning. Education can not only make the female body amended to adapt to the "ideal body" under the patriarchal system but definitely, it can also challenge the privileges of stereotyped game players (such as men, heterosexuals). Dress-up games and role-playing games are excellent channels to break physical prejudice. They are very suitable for players to explore themselves and understand diverse identities.

It is not hard to change the rules of the game. Developed gender socialization theories can appropriately guide us. In 1978, Weinreich corrected parsons' functional assumptions, and he introduces indeterminacy into the socialization process. For him, sex-role socialization by parents is a subtle and complicated process. He proposed four factors that make gender socialization uncertain, and for game design, each of them can break the fixed frame of gender polarization to varying degrees.

The first one is "frequency in the use of punishment." For the game, if the player tries some deviant gender behaviors without excessive punishment, it will help him to conduct more behaviors that challenge existing gender rules, such as homosexuality. The second is "Areas of encouragement and prohibition." If complete utopia would bring chaos to the gaming community, then we can try to loosen rules in different areas. For example, a game of liberalizing career choices and a game of liberalizing sexual choices can bring about equality of different outcomes. The third and fourth are "tolerance of sex-inappropriate behavior" and "prohibition of cross-sex behavior and traits." The increased tolerance for these two points will help players avoid moral stigma. At the same time, it will encourage players to try non-traditional gender and non-traditional sexual orientations to understand diverse groups better.

For Taobao life, deleting or providing more gender options, while removing the gender isolation boards when assigning clothing and gestures can bring significant results. This small change will provide players who are disciplined in masculinity to express their emotions, understand the "other", and provide players who are confined in femininity to show their bravery and rationality. Our games should encourage people to experience the world outside of themselves and think critically. If there is a long way to go before gender equality in reality, then at least in the game world, no matter what appearance and gender identity the players create, this identity should not create privileges or obstacles to their ability in the game.

In 1998, Justine Cassell proposed five "feminist game programming strategies." She suggested that games should:

"transfer design authority to [the] user,"
"value subjective and experiential knowledge,"
"allow use by many different kinds of users in different contexts,"
"give the user a tool to express her voice and the truth of her existence," 
"encourage collaboration among users." ([Cassell, 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461515000729?via%3Dihub#bib0055), pp. 304-305)

We can imagine that if these strategies are properly implemented, then we can at least see a non-gendered game world. Players in this world have the freedom to create their own chosen role; diversity and other experiences are respected; men and women do not need to be in a dualistic ecosystem, and strengthen their discipline to confirm their existence; Women will practice and benefit from identities in games, and may combine bravery and rationality into their real practice; men will also have the opportunity to break the hegemonic masculinity and redefine a more inclusive masculinity.
